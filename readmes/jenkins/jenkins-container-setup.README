1. Run jenkins container from docker hub:
    Usage doc: https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/README.md
    command: docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -d -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts
        In the above command, we create volume named jenkins_home, to store all the cache related to jenkins application like username etc in the host.

    Once installed, get the admin password to start jenkins:

        PS D:\React\webpack-ts-unit-auth-proj\react-webpack-typescript> docker ps
            CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                              NAMES
            5df19ee0b538   jenkins/jenkins:lts   "/usr/bin/tini -- /uâ€¦"   52 seconds ago   Up 51 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:50000->50000/tcp   zen_lovelace
    
        PS D:\React\webpack-ts-unit-auth-proj\react-webpack-typescript> docker logs 5df19ee0b538

            We get the admin password:
                Jenkins initial setup is required. An admin user has been created and a password generated.
                Please use the following password to proceed to installation:
                a52139f426b849788386f172dd94fdf6
                This may also be found at: /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

2. Copy and paste the password for installation and enter the username and password:
    username: jenkins-user
    password: jenkins
    name: jenkins
